# Honor Code

Although you are encouraged to discuss ideas with others, your programs are to be completed independently and must be your own, original work, or the work of you and your partners. Whenever you obtain significant outside help (from other students, the TAs, etc.) you should acknowledge this in your program write-up, e.g. “The idea for how to implement ARP decoding came from a discussion with Helen.” You can never get in Honor Code trouble if the help is properly credited.

The final thing we need to mention is that the Department of Computer Science uses screening software to compare student submissions. This software is very sophisticated and highly effective, and we use it to identify submissions that need to be scrutinized further by course staff. Using software of this type is common practice at many universities, and it has proved to be an effective deterrent to improper collaboration.

Programming is something you learn by doing. If you copy someone else’s work, you can expect the following:
* You will not learn what the assignment was meant to teach you.
* Your copied work will be sent to Judicial Affairs.
